		<p>So the reason we put &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; this is to tell Vim that we will be using a lot of code</p>
		<p>The reason we use &lt;html lang="en"&gt; this is so the website will show the language in english</p>
		<p>The reason we use &lt;head&gt; is the text in the head will show on the head of the tab</p>
		<p>The reason we use &lt;/head&gt;,&lt;/body&gt;,&lt;/p&gt;,and&lt;/title&gt; this tell Vim that were dobe with them</p>
		<p>The reason we use &lt;title&gt; is what will be the title of the website</p>
		<p>The reason we use &lt;body&gt; is evrything we put in the body it will be showed on the web page</p>
		<p>the reason we use &lt;p&gt; is that whatevery you write it will show in the web page</p>
